	  <h4><font color="white">What is Corona Virus?</h4>

	<p><font color="white">A<strong> coronavirus</strong> is one of a number of viruses that cause diseases in mammals and birds. In <b>humans</b>, the viruses cause respiratory infections, including the common cold, which are typically mild, though rarer forms such as <ul type=""> <li>MERS</li>
	 <li>COVID-19</li> 
	</ul>can be lethal. Symptoms vary in other species: in chickens, they cause an upper respiratory disease, while in cows and pigs coronaviruses cause diarrhea. There are no vaccines or antiviral drugs to prevent or treat human coronavirus infections.</p>

   <h4><font color="white">Detailed overview:-</h4>
   <p><font color="white">Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). A novel coronavirus (nCoV) is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans.  

Coronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning they are transmitted between animals and people.  Detailed investigations found that SARS-CoV was transmitted from civet cats to humans and MERS-CoV from dromedary camels to humans. Several known coronaviruses are circulating in animals that have not yet infected humans.

<h4><font color="white">Possible symptoms:-</h4>
<p><font color="white">Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death. </p></br>
<h4><font color="white">Precautions:-</h4>
<p><font color="white">Standard recommendations to prevent infection spread include regular hand washing, covering mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, thoroughly cooking meat and eggs. Avoid close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing.</p></br>

<p><font color="white">"The main reason for this declaration is not what is happening in China but what is happening in other countries," said <i>WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.</i>

The <b>concern</b> is that it could spread to countries with weaker health systems.
